Your task is to devise ONE sets of rhyming word pairs, each with a corresponding clue. 

Guidelines:
* The rhyming words should be thematically connected, adding an extra layer of intrigue.
* Aim for words that are challenging to guess but not obscure. Think "satisfyingly tricky."
* Prioritize cleverness and originality in both word choices and clues.
